## Install

Install as a global tool `npm install -g npm-quick-run`. This creates two aliases `nrun` and `nr`

## Use example

    $ nr t      # runs script starting with "t"
    $ nr m -w   # runs a script starting with "m", probably "npm run mocha -- -w"
    $ nr -i     # runs npm-quick-run in interactive mode

## Demo

Watch this screencast to see `npm-quick-run` in action. I am using `nr` alias

### Interactive Mode

![Demo: Interactive Mode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/87983/24231500/f791fb04-0fbf-11e7-9fa0-1d0f48efd72f.gif)

## Details

Take a look at the scripts inside your `package.json`. You probably have something like
this

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "...",
  "lint": "..."
}
```

You can quickly run tests using `nr t` and run the linter using `nr l`, assuming there are
no other script names starting with `t` or `l`. If there are, just be more specific and provide
more unique prefix.

## Extra arguments

You can pass extra arguments right after the prefix string

    nr t --watch

would be the same as

    npm run test -- --watch

which can run Mocha unit tests in the watching mode for example.

## Error handling

If there are no scripts starting with the given prefix, an error message will be shown.
If there are multiple scripts, they will be printed to the console and an error will be shown.

## Similar projects

* [as-a](https://github.com/bahmutov/as-a) adds env variables before running a command
* [json-package](https://github.com/bahmutov/json-package) quickly shows value from `package.json`
  by property name prefix
* [npm-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run) run locally-installed executables to avoid
  using long string `node node_modules/.bin/some-alias ...`
* [nrun](https://github.com/2do2go/nrun) is very similar to this project, but the script name
  completion is done via shell script, see [the relevant issue](https://github.com/2do2go/nrun/issues/3)

### Benefits compared to similar projects

* `npm-quick-run` is cross platform - the command completion is done in JS
* Boilerplate NPM error output is filtered out automatically
* Most commands require typing only 3 characters - 2 for the tool itself "nr" and 1 character for the
the script label

## Debug

If something is not working as expected, you can see the verbose debug messages
by running

    DEBUG=quick nr ...
